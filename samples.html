  <h2>Traveling Kiosks </h2>
  <p>The Disney Company is masterful at selling merchandise related to its franchises, in this case  <em>Disney on Ice</em>.  With four different shows and multiple  touring companies for each, that's lots  of Disney kiosks and paraphernalia traveling around the world to a new city every week. </p>
  <p><span class="red">The Challenge:</span> Equipment was continually getting damaged. They needed a better way to package  the kiosks and merchandise to ensure it was well protected during transport and easy to unpack and pack.   </p>
  <p><span class="red">KAISER's Solution:</span> We studied the wear and tear on the current equipment and learned more about how the marketeers were actually using it. We then designed and constructed soft, padded packaging for each of the component parts, all of which fit compactly and securely into a larger shipping container. </p>

  <h2>Pest Control </h2>
  <p>Bed bugs. No one wants them. The hospitality industry is aggressively fighting them and ________ Pest Control is helping.  Heat is the safest, cheapest, and  most effective way to eradicate  bed bugs, which  cannot live at temperatures above  115 degrees Fahrenheit.  
  <p><span class="red">The Challenge:</span> The heat generated by the  large  heating units being placed in hotel rooms also set off the sprinkler system. In addition, the heating units consumed large amounts of electricity. 
  <p><span class="red">KAISER's Solution:</span> We designed and constructed insulated covers for the sprinkler heads. Made from nylon and  styrofoam, now the sprinkler system cannot detect the elevated temperatures.  We also designed an  inflatable divider system  with  baffles to isolate discrete areas for treatment,  reducing heat loss and energy consumption.

  <h2>Noise Reduction </h2>
  <p>Automotive assembly lines  can be loud. OSHA regulations require employers supply hearing protection to all employees exposed to noises of 85 decibels or greater, averaged over an 8-hour time-weighted period.  </p>
  <p><span class="red">The Challenge:</span> Ear protection is expensive. Employee may forget to wear it. It can be uncomfortable. Enforcement becomes an issue. Is there a better solution? ________ had already identified what pieces of equipment were operating outside the sound limits. </p>
  <p><span class="red">KAISER's Solution:</span> Box in the offending equipment. with custom-made accoustic panels, resulting in a quieter work environment and cost savings by eliminating the need for ear protection. </p>

  <h2>Athletic Facility Padding </h2>
  <p>Every angle, hard edge and upright in sports venues &#8212; from hockey rinks to indoor soccer to ski mountains &#8212;  needs protective padding.  KAISER works with a distributors across the country to supply custom padding for almost every sports venue imaginable. The Pettit National Ice Center in, an U.S. Olympic training site in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, is one example. </p>
  <p><span class="red">The Challenge:</span> This showcase athletic facility needed  custom padding to cushion   in the  400-meter indoor speed skating oval,  two Olympic-size   ice rinks and an elevated run/walk track. The configurations had to be removable to accommodate long- and short-track speed skating, hockey,  figure skating and curling. </p>
  <p><span class="red">KAISER's Solution:</span> Working with a distributor, we delivered hundreds of different padding configurations made from high density foam and vinyl in red, white and blue. Take a look at the <a href="http://www.thepettit.com/" target="_blank">Pettit National Ice Center website</a> to see the results. </p>
